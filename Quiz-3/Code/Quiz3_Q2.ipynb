notice a harmful situation is about to happen , is currently happening or has already happened , and then they make a conscious decision to step in and intervene . in the previous scenario , an active bystander would see the collision but stop to call uscpd and report the incident changing carolina peers leaders changing carolina peer leaders ( ccpl ) program is a student-run organization that

equal opportunity program ’ s website . however , the reporter should know that , during the course of an investigation , his/her identity may be discovered . if that occurs , the reporter will

is a required educational and training module about sexual assault prevention . the course uses realistic scenarios and skill-building exercises . similar in structure to alcoholedu , it is broken into two parts . part i takes around an hour and a half to complete . after a 30-45 day waiting period , students must complete part ii , which takes about 15 minutes page 44 annual security and fire safety report criminal statistics university of south carolina division of law enforcement and safety how we compile these statistics a primary part of the annual security and fire safety report is the statistics related to crime that have occurred at the university during the preceding calendar year to assist in evaluating the statistics in context , the preceding three calendar years are provided for your review dles , in compiling the annual statistics , coordinates with law enforcement partners as well as university campus security authorities dles , along with the richland county sheriff ’ s department and the city of columbia police department , share information about criminal incidents through the lexis/nexis community crime map community crime map the community crime map ( www.communitycrimemap.com ) is a crime mapping program made available to both the general public and law enforcement.the program allows site visitors to see crime data over a map of the county through the community crime map system , dles , the richland county sheriff ’ s department , and city of columbia police department can share crime data , crime intelligence , and criminal reports this program also allows dles , when compiling the annual security and fire safety report to directly retrieve informa-tion about crimes occurring off campus or on public property investigated by another agency a public version of the community crime map program is also available the public system allows a user to search crimes by address or by clicking on columbia , south carolina.the user interface shows a map of a particular area with incidents clearly marked . by clicking on the incident location pin , the user obtains basic information about the incident such as : type of crime ; location type ; block-level address ; and incident date and time sex offender data sex offender data is maintained and provided by the south carolina law enforcement division ( sled ) , which may be accessed via the following link : http : //scor.sled.sc.gov registered sex offenders are prohibited from living in campus student housing . individuals found in the registry are not necessarily students , faculty , or staff . individuals registered may carry on a vocation at the university of south carolina such as a contractor or subcon-tractor . crime data the clery act requires the university to report data regarding specific crimes that happen within a defined geographical area to the united states department of education and then disclose the data to the general community this area is referred to as “ clery geography ” and encompasses on campus ( including the subset of on campus residence halls ) , non-campus , and public property these terms create consistency in the way crime data is collected and reported across college campuses for purposes of the clery act and understanding disclosed data , the following definitions are used : 1 ) on-campus is defined as either – a . a ny property – owned or c ontrolled by the university ; that is reasonably contiguous to other university owned property ; and that is used by the university in direct support or in relation to the university ’ s educational purpose or page 46 annual security and fire safety report university of south carolina division of law enforcement and safety b . any property – owned but not controlled by the university ; that is used frequently by university students ; and that is used to support the university ’ s educational purpose . 2 ) non-campus is defined as either – a . a ny property – owned or controlled by the university ; that is used by the university to support its educational purposes ; that is frequently used by students ; and is not c onsidered part of the core campus . or b . any property – owned or controlled by a student organization ; and that the student organization is officially recognized by the university . 3 ) public p roperty is defined as any property owned or controlled by governmental entities such as thoroughfares , streets , sidewalks , and parking facilities ; that is within the campus , or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus . an example of on-campus property would be many of the university classrooms and buildings located throughout its core campus . non-campus areas include williams-brice stadium . public property would be the public sidewalk located in front of the horseshoe the crimes are collectively referred to as “ clery crimes ” , the clery crimes consist of four categories of offenses : 1 ) index crimes ; 2 )

fire safety awareness day ” to coincide with “ national fire safety week ” in october of each year . during the event a mock residence hall room is constructed and fire hazards are intentionally created within the room . students are encouraged to identify the hazard to win prizes the columbia fire department assists and displays equipment and rescue techniques the room is set on fire at the end of the event to demonstrate how quickly a room will burn and how important it is to follow established fire safety policies and procedures all students and employees must evacuate the building or residence hall in the event of a fire and follow the below procedures : some of these actions can be taken simultaneously : the building shall be evacuated . in those buildings that have coded alarm
